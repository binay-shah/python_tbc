After the body of the loop has executed, we don't move on to the next line yet; we go back to the **for** heading line, where the iteration variable takes the value of the next element of the iterable. In the second iteration of the loop above, **city** takes the value of the next element in **cities**, which is \"mountain view\".\n",
    "6. This process repeats until the loop has iterated through all the elements of the iterable. Then, we move on to the line that follows the body of the loop - in this case, **print(\"Done!\")**. We can tell what the next line after the body of the loop is because it is unindented. Here is another reason why paying attention to your indentation is very important in Python!\n",

These two can actually be combined to create a useful counter dictionary, something you will likely come across again. For example, we can create a dictionary, word_counter, that keeps track of the total count of each word in a string.\n",

    "- Since it doesn't yet, the statement **word_counter[word] = 1** adds great as a key to the dictionary with a value of 1.\n",
    "- Then, it leaves the if else statement and moves on to the next iteration of the for loop. **word** now takes the value expectations and repeats the process.\n",
    "- When the if condition is not met, it is because that **word** already exists in the **word_counter** dictionary, and the statement **word_counter[word] = word_counter[word] + 1** increases the count of that word by 1.\n",
