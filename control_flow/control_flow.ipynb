    "Let's break this down.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An `if` statement starts with the `if` keyword, followed by the condition to be checked, in this case `phone_balance` < 5, and then a colon. The condition is specified in a boolean expression that evaluates to either True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. After this line is an indented block of code to be executed if that condition is true. Here, the lines that increment `phone_balance` and decrement `bank_balance` only execute if it is true that `phone_balance` is less than 5. If not, the code in this if block is simply skipped."

    "# Use Comparison Operators in Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "You have learned about Python's comparison operators (e.g. `==` and `!=`) and how they are different from assignment operators (e.g. `=`). In conditional statements, you want to use comparison operators. For example, you'd want to use `if x == 5` rather than `if x = 5`. If your conditional statement is causing a syntax error or doing something unexpected, check whether you have written `==` or `=!`"

    "\n",
    "`elif`: `elif` is short for \"else if.\" An `elif` clause is used to check for an additional condition if the conditions in the previous clauses in the `if` statement evaluate to False. As you can see in the example, you can have multiple `elif` blocks to handle different situations.\n",
    "\n",
