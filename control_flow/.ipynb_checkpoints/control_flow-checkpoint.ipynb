After the body of the loop has executed, we don't move on to the next line yet; we go back to the **for** heading line, where the iteration variable takes the value of the next element of the iterable. In the second iteration of the loop above, **city** takes the value of the next element in **cities**, which is \"mountain view\".\n",
    "6. This process repeats until the loop has iterated through all the elements of the iterable. Then, we move on to the line that follows the body of the loop - in this case, **print(\"Done!\")**. We can tell what the next line after the body of the loop is because it is unindented. Here is another reason why paying attention to your indentation is very important in Python!\n",

    "By now you are familiar with two important concepts: 1) counting with **for** loops and 2) the dictionary **get** method. These two can actually be combined to create a useful counter dictionary, something you will likely come across again. For example, we can create a dictionary, word_counter, that keeps track of the total count of each word in a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are a couple of ways to do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 1: Using a for loop to create a set of counters\n",

    "\n",

    "for word in book_title:\n",
    "    if word not in word_counter:\n",
    "        word_counter[word] = 1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        word_counter[word] += 1\n",
    "```     \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What's happening here?\n",
    "- The **for** loop iterates through each element in the list. For the first iteration, **word** takes the value 'great'.\n",
    "- Next, the if statement checks if **word** is in the **word_counter** dictionary.\n",
    "- Since it doesn't yet, the statement **word_counter[word] = 1** adds great as a key to the dictionary with a value of 1.\n",
    "- Then, it leaves the if else statement and moves on to the next iteration of the for loop. **word** now takes the value expectations and repeats the process.\n",
    "- When the if condition is not met, it is because that **word** already exists in the **word_counter** dictionary, and the statement **word_counter[word] = word_counter[word] + 1** increases the count of that word by 1.\n",
    "- Once the **for** loop finishes iterating through the list, the **for** loop is complete.\n",

If unspecified, this default value is set to None. We can use **get** with a default value of 0 to simplify the code from the first method above.\n",
    "\n",
