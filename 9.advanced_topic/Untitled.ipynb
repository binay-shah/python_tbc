    "# Iterators And Generators\n",
    "**Iterables** are objects that can return one of their elements at a time, such as a list. Many of the built-in functions we’ve used so far, like 'enumerate,' return an iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **iterator** is an object that represents a stream of data. This is different from a list, which is also an iterable, but is not an iterator because it is not a stream of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generators** are a simple way to create iterators using functions. You can also define iterators using classes, which you can read more about [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#iterators).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a generator function called `my_range`, which produces an iterator that is a stream of numbers from 0 to (x - 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_range(x):\n",
    "    i = 0\n",
    "    while i < x:\n",
    "        yield i\n",
    "        i += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that instead of using the return keyword, it uses `yield`. This allows the function to return values one at a time, and start where it left off each time it’s called. This `yield` keyword is what differentiates a generator from a typical function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, since this returns an iterator, we can convert it to a list or iterate through it in a loop to view its contents. For example, this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for x in my_range(5):\n",
    "    print(x)\n",
    "```   \n",
    "\n",
    "outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "```"
