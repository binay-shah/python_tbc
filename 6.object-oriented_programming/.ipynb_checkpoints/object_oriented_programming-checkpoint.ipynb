    "# Python Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a structure in object-oriented programming that allows functions and related data to be grouped together.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Python class, an important concept is **self**, which is used to reference a class instance's own variables and functions from within the class definition. For example, if we had a class called **Person** and we wanted the class instances to have a variable called **age**, we could store this information by using **self.age**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, if we wanted the class to have a function that would increment the age of the person, we could define a function inside this class called def **birthday(self)**. In order to be a class function, **birthday** needs to include the input variable **self**, as this is used for proper referencing within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important and commonly used function definition is the class initializer, def **__init__(self)**. The body of the initializer is where instance variable definitions should be added, and the initializer initializes all the variables once an instance of the class is created. Also, any input variables that a class needs to have, such as a name for the person can be passed into initializer function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples of Python Classes\n",
    "Below is an example of a basic Person class. The class has two variables for name and age, along with three functions for initializing the class, incrementing the person’s age, and getting the person’s name.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.person_name = name\n",
    "        self.person_age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def birthday(self):\n",
    "        self.person_age += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    def getName(self):\n",
    "        return self.person_name\n",
    "```     \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at an example for how to create an instance of the **Person** class using the class template above. We can then access that **Person’s** name:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bob = Person('Bob', 32)\n",
    "print(bob.getName())\n",
    "# prints Bob\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, we have one function for getting the class’s variable. This is called an Accessor. The other function that the class has is actually modifying one of the class’ variables, and that is called a Mutator. We can make our **Person** older by calling **birthday()**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bob.birthday()\n",
    "print(bob.person_age)\n",
    "# prints 33\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The birthday function call successfully increments the age of our **Person**. Also note that we can directly get the age of bob without using a function call. This is because the **Person** class variables are defined as public, so we can directly access them without a function call. If instead we wanted the **Person’s** age variable to be private to the class, in Python 3 we could put double underscores in front of the variable: **__person_age**. Then we would have to use a function call in order to retrieve it."
