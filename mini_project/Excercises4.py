BUILDING LISTS OF RANDOM NUMBERS; RETURNING FUNCTIONAL VALUES

Sometimes you need a list of numbers. Here is a way to build a list of pseudo-
random numbers. We again import the python library random. It furnishes a 
random integer generator called randint(). 

Note the basic loop design pattern reappears.  

The function make_random() below builds a list of random integers using the
randint() function from the random library.  Note that we do not print the list
out as we usually do.  Instead we use another function to call the make_random()
function and print it in the calling function.

""" 
For testing your program, however, it can be deadly to have a different set of 
random numbers each time it is run. That's a formula for madness: sometimes 
your program may work and sometimes not, depending on the particular random 
numbers that happen to be generated on that run. Consequently, it can be very 
hard to track down the error.  For testing purposes, you can generate the same 
random numbers over and over again by setting the random number generator's 
seed to the same value each time.

Ctrl-Enter to execute and see the result.  Or you can up-arrow and modify
the previous version.
a) Use {0} to just print the string with no formating; {} does the same thing
b) Use {0:25} to print the string allowing a width of 25 characters for it
c) Use {0:>25} to print the string right-aligned in a space of 25 characters

e) Use {0:^25} to print the string centered in a space of 25 characters
